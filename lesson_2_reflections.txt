What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git directory is added and git begins to use version control on the directory.  It needs to be done so that Git knows what to keep track of.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is not an actual directory.  The value is in seeing which files are changing before a commit is done.
