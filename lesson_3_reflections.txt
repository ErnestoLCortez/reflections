When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It would be important to use remote if working from multiple locations, collaborating with others, or for redundancy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It may pull and out of date copy or and update from a collaborator.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is copying a repository that is on github to github.  A clone is copying a remote repository to local computer.  And branch is creating another version inside the repository.
